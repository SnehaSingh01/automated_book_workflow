The sun beat down on Dick as he stood on the coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the ocean roared, a tempestuous symphony of crashing waves and wind-blown spray. Before him, the tranquil azure lagoon of Karolin stretched to the horizon, alive with the cries of fishing gulls.  This immense, forty-mile-wide coral ring, a raging ocean in storms, a placid lake in gentler breezes, was now his. He, a newcomer, had arrived only yesterday.

The beach throbbed with life: women, children, and young men, all members of his newly adopted tribe, were engrossed in their daily routines—fishing, playing, tending the taro patches.  The canoes resting on the sand, the empty houses that once sheltered war canoes—all were now his responsibility.

But as his eyes shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a shadow crossed his brow. He turned from the tranquil waters to face the tumultuous northern sea. Beyond the horizon, invisible for now, lay Palm Tree, an island of breathtaking beauty, a paradise tragically marred by a sinister presence—devils, as the locals believed.

Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, watched him from the coral.  Untouched by life's harsh realities, Tari understood only that the men of Karolin lost in war had left behind defenseless women and children. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, bearing a stranger—Dick—and Katafa, a girl lost at sea years before. The women hailed Dick as a god-sent chief, a leader.

With the innocent directness of childhood, Tari asked, "Taori, who are you?"

Dick struggled for an answer. Could he explain his true identity—Dick Lestrange, a boy abandoned on Palm Tree with an old sailor named Kearney? Could he recount their life there: Kearney's mentorship, the building of miniature ships, the arrival of Katafa, their escape from the murderous Melanesians who had overrun the island? The memories were hazy, the language of his childhood lost. Only his life with Katafa on Palm Tree remained vivid; the years before were shrouded in a tropical mist. Kearney himself was fading, a ghost in his memories, except for the tiny ships, relics of a forgotten past.

He looked down at the child. "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?"

"I do not know," Tari replied, his attention already shifting to the cries of children hauling in a net. "I ask as I breathe, but grown-ups never answer Tari's questions. Ai, the fish!"

Dick's gaze returned to the north. The child's question stirred dormant memories: the burning schooner, the desperate escape with Katafa in Kearney's old dinghy, their arrival on this beach, the welcoming but expectant tribe. But overriding the relief was the chilling memory of the Melanesians, the savage violence that still echoed in his mind.

There was no immediate threat. The Palm Tree inhabitants lacked canoes, for now. But they would build them. They would see the shimmering reflection of Karolin's lagoon in the sky, as he had, and they would come. It might be a long time, but they would come.

Dick was, in many ways, a savage, a kanaka. Yet, remnants of his white upbringing remained. He could strategize, anticipate, imagine. This is why he had dispatched a canoe for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three skilled but elderly canoe builders. This is why, observing the tribe, his eyes had been drawn to the nearly one hundred young men nearing fighting age. But above all, fueling his ambition and daring, was his love for Katafa, a love now subtly threatened.

War canoes. Would he fight defensively, repelling invaders within the lagoon? Or would he strike preemptively, eliminating the threat before it materialized?

A hand touched his shoulder. Katafa stood before him, a stray lock of dark hair dancing like an eagle's feather in the breeze. Her luminous eyes, usually fixed on his, were now focused on the north, mirroring his own gaze.

"Look," she whispered.

Palm Tree, visible only under specific conditions, reappeared through a mirage, a faint smudge on the horizon that grew steadily clearer, revealing its idyllic beauty. Yet, for them, it was no paradise; it was a haunting reminder of their ordeal. As they stood silently, oblivious to the science of the mirage, the memory of their escape flooded back—the monstrous figures of the Melanesians, the wind-filled sail of their dinghy, the screams of the drunken savages. And there, before them, stood the scene of their trauma, veiled in deceptive beauty.

Dick's nostrils flared, his eyes blazing with hate. They had threatened him, but it was the threat to Katafa that ignited his fury. They would come. The vision of Palm Tree, the mirage itself, seemed to confirm the instinctual dread gnawing at his heart. They would build canoes. They would see the lagoon's reflection in the sky. They would come. They craved women, and Karolin's women were their target.

Danger lay not just in the north, but wherever greed and hatred lurked on that seemingly tranquil sea. The threat was not merely savage; it was the darker, more insidious threat of civilization itself. Dick knew only the limited world encompassing the two islands, yet even in that small realm, he had learned to fear men, to understand the primal forces driving humanity—war, plunder, destruction.

Then, as swiftly as it had appeared, the vision of Palm Tree vanished. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe from the south. It was the canoe sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, they walked down to the beach, ready to face whatever the future held.
