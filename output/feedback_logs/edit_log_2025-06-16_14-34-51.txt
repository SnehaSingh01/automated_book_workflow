The sun beat down on Dick as he stood on the coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the ocean roared, a tempestuous curtain of white spray whipped by the wind. Before him lay the tranquil lagoon of Karolin, a vast expanse of calm, sapphire water dotted with graceful fishing gulls.  Enclosed within its forty-mile coral ring, this serene sea was his—a kingdom claimed only yesterday.

The beach teemed with life: women, children, and young men, all the inhabitants of Karolin, toiling under the relentless sun. They fished, played, and tended their taro patches—all now under his dominion. His were the canoes drawn on the sand; his, the empty houses that once sheltered war canoes.

His brow furrowed as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the silent canoe houses. Turning from the tranquil waters, he faced the relentless breakers of the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, invisible yet ever-present, lay Palm Tree—a breathtakingly beautiful paradise, haunted by demons.

Little Tari, son of the net-maker Le Taioi, watched him from the coral. Tari, a child who knew little of the world, understood only that war had swept away Karolin's men, leaving the women and children defenseless. Then, yesterday, a strange man had arrived from the north, in a strange boat, with Katafa, the girl lost at sea years before. The women whispered he was sent by the gods, their new chief.

Unaware of the women's whispers, Tari, emboldened by the new man's presence, posed the simple question burning in his innocent heart: "Taori," he asked, "who are you?"

Dick could have answered, could have spun a tale of a life beyond Tari’s comprehension: a childhood spent on Palm Tree with Kearney, an old sailor; learning to fish and build small ships; Katafa's arrival and their escape from the brutal Melanesians who had ravaged their island. But the name "Dick Lestrange" was a ghost; the language of his childhood lost. His memories, blurred by years of solitude, began only with Katafa's arrival on Palm Tree.  The time before was a hazy, sun-drenched dream, overshadowed only by Kearney's memory—kept alive by the miniature ships he'd crafted.

He looked down at the child's earnest face. "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?"

"I do not know," Tari replied, his attention already diverted by children hauling in a net. "I ask as I breathe…"

Dick's gaze returned to the north. The child's question stirred his dormant past. He saw the burning schooner; himself and Katafa escaping in Kearney's old dinghy; their arrival on this beach, the villagers' welcoming yet apprehensive faces; and finally, the Melanesians' brutality staining the beauty of sea and sky.

The immediate threat from Palm Tree was nonexistent; the islanders lacked canoes. But they would build them. They would see Karolin’s lagoon, as he had, and they would come. It might take time, but they would come.

Though a kanaka, Dick possessed a white man's strategic, imaginative, and far-sighted mind. He’d already sent for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, master canoe-builders, and noted the burgeoning strength of Karolin's young warriors. Above all, his actions were fueled by a fierce love for Katafa, a love threatened by the shadow of Palm Tree.

War canoes: Would he defend Karolin or launch a preemptive strike? The answer remained elusive.

A hand rested on his shoulder. Katafa stood beside him, a stray lock of dark hair dancing on the breeze like an eagle’s feather. Her luminous eyes were fixed on the northern horizon, where a hazy image was materializing—Palm Tree, revealed by a mirage.

"Look," she whispered.

Silently, they watched as the island emerged from the sea-dazzle, a phantom from their past, a haunting reminder of their escape. The memory of savage faces and the cries of the Melanesians flooded back. Yet, before them lay the island's idyllic beauty, masking the lurking threat.

Dick's nostrils flared, his eyes hardening with hate. They had threatened him, but they had threatened Katafa—and that was everything. They would come. They would build canoes and follow the guiding light. They had no women, and Karolin's women would be their prize. Danger lurked not only in the north but wherever greed and hatred held sway—among savages and the wolves of civilization alike.

For Dick, the world consisted only of the sea encircling Karolin and Palm Tree. Yet, even in this limited world, he understood the primal urge for war, conquest, and destruction.

Then, as abruptly as it appeared, the vision of Palm Tree faded. Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the south—the canoe bearing the canoe-builders. Leaving the coral, they walked toward the beach to meet it.
