## The Gates of Morning: Book 1, Chapter 1 - The Canoe Builder

Dick perched on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the relentless Pacific thundered, its spray whipped into a frenzy by the wind. Before him, the tranquil lagoon of Karolin stretched—a vast expanse of azure, alive only with the cries of circling gulls. This tranquil expanse, ringed by forty miles of coral, was his—his since his arrival only yesterday.

The beach bustled with life: women, children, and young men toiled under the relentless sun, mending nets, playing games, and tending the paraka patches. They were all his people now. The canoes drawn on the sand, the empty houses that once sheltered war canoes—all were his.

But as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a shadow crossed his brow. Turning from the placid water, he faced the tumultuous northern ocean. Beyond the horizon, invisible yet ever-present in his mind, lay Palm Tree Island—a paradise veiled in alluring dreams, yet a place teeming with devils.

Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, watched him from the coral. Untouched by life's harsh realities, Tari knew only that war had swept Karolin's men away, leaving the women and children defenseless and leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, carrying Katafa—a girl lost at sea years ago—and this stranger. The women whispered he was sent by the gods, destined to be their chief.

Tari, oblivious to the gods' whims, simply wanted answers. With childlike directness, he asked the question burning in his young heart: "Taori," he said, "who are you?"

Could Dick have answered truthfully? Could the child have understood a life beyond Tari's world? Could he have explained that he was Dick Lestrange, a boy abandoned on Palm Tree Island with an old sailor named Kearney? Kearney had taught him to fish and build small ships, unlike the island canoes. Then Katafa had arrived, the girl lost in the storm, and they'd lived together until Kearney's death. She'd taught him Karolin's language, named him Taori, and they'd loved each other until brutal Melanesians slaughtered the white men on their island, burned their ship, and forced their escape.

But he couldn't.  "Dick" was a faded echo, swallowed by the blinding tropical light and storms of his past. Only his life with Katafa on Palm Tree Island remained clear; everything before was a hazy dream, except for the memory of Kearney's miniature ships—a testament to a forgotten past.

He looked at the inquisitive child.  "I am Taori, Tari tatu," he said. "Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Tari replied. "I ask as I breathe, but grown-ups never answer my questions… Ai, the fish!" His attention flitted to children hauling in a net, and he scampered away.

Dick's gaze returned to the north. The child's question stirred dormant memories: the schooner consumed by flames, his escape with Katafa, their landing on this beach, the villagers' awe. But the memory of the escaped men—a dark stain on the beauty of the sea and sky—cast a long shadow.

Though the Melanesians lacked canoes for now, he knew they would build them. They would see Karolin's shimmering lagoon, just as he had, and they would come. It might take time, but they would come.

Dick was a kanaka, a savage, yet possessed a white man's mind. He could plan, analyze, and imagine. This is why he'd sent a canoe for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—three skilled canoe builders—and why, observing the tribe, his gaze lingered on the nearly hundred youths reaching fighting age. Above all, fueling his daring, was his love for Katafa, a love threatened by the looming shadow of war.

War canoes… Would he defend the lagoon or strike first, eliminating the threat at its source? The answer remained elusive.

A hand rested on his shoulder. He turned to find Katafa; a dark tress escaped its vine binding, fluttering like an eagle's feather in the breeze. Her luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the northern sea line, the same point he'd been gazing at.

"Look," she whispered.

At certain times, through the magic of mirage, distant Palm Tree Island became visible. Last night they had seen it, and now it reappeared, a faint stain on the horizon, gradually sharpening until the island emerged—a diaphanous yet vivid dream.

Shoulder to shoulder, they stood in silence, their untutored minds unaware of the mirage, their eyes fixed on their escape route. The horde of savages on the beach—monstrous figures from a nightmare—were once again before them. They felt the wind in their sails, heard the yells of the rum-maddened Melanesians. The beautiful island concealed the demons that still inhabited it.

As Dick gazed upon this beauty—this threat—hate flared in his eyes. They had threatened him—that was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa—that was everything. And they still threatened her.

Someday they would come. The vision of Palm Tree Island seemed to confirm his instincts. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's light, and come. They lacked women; Karolin had them in abundance. The same instinct that drew him to Katafa would draw them to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon, seeking a vulnerable tribe, and they would come.

The danger, he realized, lay not just in the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed—among savages and civilized men alike. For Dick, there was no world beyond the surrounding waters, no history but his short life with Katafa. Yet, even in that short life, he'd learned to fear men, to understand the primal forces of war, rapine, and destruction.

Then, as abruptly as it appeared, the vision of Palm Tree Island faded. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe from the southern beach. It was the canoe bearing the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they descended to the white sand to meet it.
