The sun beat down on Dick as he stood on the coral ledge, gazing at the southern horizon. Behind him, the relentless Pacific thundered, its spray a white confetti scattered by the wind. Before him lay the tranquil azure lagoon of Karolin, a vast expanse alive with the cries of fishing gulls.  Encircled by forty miles of coral, this breathtaking lagoon was his – a tempestuous fury in strong winds, a mirror of the sky in gentle breezes – his since his arrival the previous day.

The beach buzzed with activity: women, children, and youths, a vibrant tableau under the blazing sun. They fished, played, and tended their paraka patches – all now under his rule.  The canoes drawn on the sand, the empty houses that once housed war canoes – these were his too. But as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a shadow crossed his brow. He turned from the tranquil waters, facing the churning breakers and the vast northern sea. Beyond the horizon, invisible yet ever-present, lay Palm Tree – a breathtakingly beautiful island, a paradise masking a demonic heart.

Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, watched him from the coral.  Tari, a child untouched by life's complexities, understood the vulnerability of Karolin's people. War had decimated their men, leaving women, children, and boys like himself defenseless and leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the northern sea, bearing Katafa – a girl lost at sea years ago – and this enigmatic stranger. The women whispered he was sent by the gods, their new chief.

Unaware of the whispers, Tari seized the opportunity to ask a simple question, his childlike directness shining through:  "Taori," he said, "who are you?"

Could Dick have answered truthfully? Could Tari have understood the tale of Dick Lestrange, a boy abandoned on Palm Tree with an old sailor named Kearney?  A tale of a life amidst the island's beauty, of lessons learned from Kearney, of small, hand-crafted ships unlike any Karolin canoe. A tale of Katafa's return, their shared life on Palm Tree, their escape from brutal Melanesian loggers who burned their schooner, forcing them to flee in a small boat, guided by the lagoon's shimmering light.

But the name "Dick," and the language of his childhood, were fading memories. Only his arrival with Katafa on Marua (Palm Tree) and their escape remained vivid. Kearney was a hazy figure, almost lost in the blaze of tropical sunlight, storms, and the mists of the rainy season. Only the small, wooden ships remained as tangible reminders of a nearly forgotten life.

He looked down at Tari's questioning eyes.  "I am Taori, Tari tatu," he said. "Why do you ask?"

"I do not know," Tari replied, his attention already diverted by children hauling in a net. "I ask as I breathe…" He skipped away, his curiosity satisfied.

Dick's gaze returned to the north. The child's question had stirred something within him. He saw again the burning schooner, Katafa and himself escaping in Kearney's dinghy, their arrival on this beach, the women and children welcoming him as a divinely appointed chief. But the memory of the escaped loggers stained the beauty of the sea and sky.

There was no immediate threat; the men of Palm Tree lacked canoes, but it was only a matter of time. They would build canoes, they would see Karolin's shimmering lagoon, and they would come. He was a kanaka, a savage, yet the white man remained. He could plan, strategize, and imagine – this fueled his resolve, ignited by his love for Katafa, a love constantly, though vaguely, threatened.

War canoes! Would he defend the lagoon, or strike first? The question remained unanswered.

A hand rested on his shoulder. Katafa stood before him, a dark tress escaping its vine binding, fluttering like an eagle's feather in the breeze. Her luminous dark eyes were fixed on the same point he'd been gazing at – the northern horizon.

"Look," she whispered.

Palm Tree, usually hidden, was appearing through the shimmering heat haze.  They had seen it yesterday; now, it slowly materialized, a hazy stain deepening, solidifying into a hauntingly beautiful island, a vision of paradise obscuring its dark reality.

They stood silently, gazing at the island of their escape, their minds untutored in the science of mirages. They relived the terror of their escape: the monstrous figures on the beach, the wind filling their sails, the screams of the drunken loggers. The beauty before them hid the demons within.

Dick's nostrils flared, his eyes filled with hate. They had threatened him, but more importantly, Katafa. The threat persisted. One day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to reiterate what instinct told him: They would build canoes, see the lagoon's light, and come. They craved women, and Karolin's women were their prize.

The danger, he realized, wasn't confined to the north. Greed, desire, and hatred lurked wherever they roamed, not just amongst savages but among the wolves of civilization.

To Dick, the world was limited by the ocean surrounding the two islands, a world devoid of Europe, America, or any history beyond his own brief life and Katafa's. Yet, even within this limited experience, he understood the primal fear of mankind, the inherent instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.

Gradually, the vision of Palm Tree faded. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe. It was the canoe he'd sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they descended to the beach to meet it.
