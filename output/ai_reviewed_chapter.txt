## The Gates of Morning: Book 1, Chapter 1 - The Canoe Builder

Dick perched on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the relentless Pacific roared, its spray whipped into a frenzy by the wind. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched—a tranquil expanse of sapphire water, dotted with graceful fishing gulls. This haven, encircled by a forty-mile coral reef, was a world unto itself: a raging sea in a storm, a tranquil lake in a gentle breeze. And it was his—his since claiming it only yesterday.

The beach bustled with life: women, children, and youths, all members of his newly adopted tribe, toiled under the relentless sun. They cast nets, played games, and tended their paraka patches.  Canoes rested high on the sand, the empty houses that once sheltered war canoes—all now his.

But as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a shadow crossed his brow. Turning from the placid waters, he faced the turbulent ocean and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, unseen yet ever-present, lay Palm Tree Island—a paradise dreamt of, yet a viper's nest of savagery.

Nearby, little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, watched him. Tari, a child who knew little of the world, understood only that war had swept away Karolin's men, leaving the women and children vulnerable and leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, bearing this enigmatic figure and Katafa, the girl lost at sea years ago. The women whispered he was sent by the gods to be their chief.

Oblivious to the gods' whims, and seizing the opportunity presented by this wondrous stranger and his mother's absence, Tari blurted out, with childlike simplicity: "Taori," he asked, "who are you?"

Could Dick have answered truthfully? Could the child have comprehended the extraordinary tale? He could have said, "Tari, I come from a world beyond yours. My name is Dick Lestrange. As a child, I was shipwrecked on the island you call Marua (Palm Tree), fifty miles north, with an old sailor named Kearney. He taught me to fish, to hunt, and to build small ships, unlike your canoes. Then Katafa arrived, the girl lost in the storm. After Kearney died, we escaped the brutal Melanesian invaders who had burned their ship and taken everything, fleeing in our small boat, guided by the lagoon's light to Karolin."

But the words caught in his throat. The name "Dick," and the language of his childhood, had faded, lost in the hazy memories of his past. His past, since his shipwreck, was a blur, its edges softened by the relentless tropical sun and violent storms. Only the memory of Katafa's arrival on Marua and the little ships Kearney had crafted remained clear.

He looked down at the inquiring child.  "I am Taori, Tari tatu," he said softly.  "Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Tari replied, his attention already diverted by children hauling in a net. "I ask, like I breathe. But the big folk—never answer Tari."  And with that, the child was gone.

Dick's gaze returned to the north. The child's question had stirred a dormant memory: the burning schooner on Palm Tree, his escape with Katafa, their arrival on this beach. The women and children believing him a divinely appointed chief…

But the memory of the men he'd escaped with tainted the beauty of the sky. The immediate threat was gone, but the men of Palm Tree were resourceful. They would build canoes, they would see Karolin's lagoon shimmering in the sky, and they would come. It might take time, but they would come.

Dick, a kanaka, a savage, yet possessed the intellect of a civilized man. He could plan, strategize, and anticipate. This is why he'd dispatched a canoe for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three elderly but skilled canoe builders. This is why, observing the tribe, his eyes had lit up at the sight of nearly a hundred youths reaching fighting age. But underpinning all his plans, fueling his daring, was his love for Katafa, a love subtly threatened.

War canoes… would he defend the lagoon, or launch a preemptive strike? The answer remained elusive.

A hand rested on his shoulder. He turned to find Katafa; a strand of dark hair escaped her vine-bound braid, fluttering like an eagle's feather in the breeze. Her dark eyes, usually sparkling with warmth, were fixed on the northern horizon.

"Look," she breathed.

Palm Tree, visible only under specific conditions, was reappearing, a mirage conjuring the island from the sea's shimmering expanse.  Yesterday, they had seen it, and now, it was slowly materializing—a hazy stain that sharpened and solidified, revealing its breathtaking beauty.

They stood in silence, their untutored minds oblivious to the mirage, their eyes locked on the scene of their escape. They saw the savages, monstrous figures; felt the wind filling their sail; heard the bloodcurdling cries of the drunken Melanesians. The idyllic vision concealed a demonic reality.

As Dick gazed upon the beautiful yet menacing island, hate flared in his eyes. They had threatened him, but they had threatened Katafa—that was everything. They would come. Palm Tree's reappearance was a chilling reminder. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's reflection, and they would come. They craved women, and Karolin had women. The threat wasn't just from the north; it lurked wherever greed and desire roamed, among savages and civilized men alike.

For Dick, the world extended only to the waters surrounding the two islands. There was no Europe, no America, no history but his own, shared with Katafa. Yet, even in their short lives, they had learned to fear men, and to understand the primal instinct for war, violence, and destruction.

Slowly, Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing like a snuffed candle. Turning from the sea, Katafa pointed towards a canoe approaching from the southern beach—the canoe bearing the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, they walked towards the white sand to meet it.
